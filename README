This program finds the minimal set of steps required to complete a
https://wafflegame.net/ puzzle, if given the initial state of the board and
final state.

This does require you to solve it off line, but if you can correctly do that,
this program will tell you which blocks to swap to always get 5 stars.

I don't recommend using it to cheat, because it's considerably more difficult
to solve it off line without the clues and feedback it gives you, as well as
being less fun, but it was a fun challenge to write.
